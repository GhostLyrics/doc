# Doc

This is a collection of linux and macOS commands, command pipelines and tiny
code samples that have helped me in the past.

- Commands are sorted by topic
- Snippets are sorted by technology

I've tried to keep the code samples as small as possible, sacrificing clean
linter runs of each individual file for readability and brevity.

## Notes

I urge you to always use long flags (e.g. `--long`) when writing a script 
to improve readability and allow easier maintenance
(in comparison to short flags, e.g. `-s`).

This repository strives to always use long flags whenever possible but some
tools do not offer long flags.
